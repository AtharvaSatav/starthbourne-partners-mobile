# GitHub Actions Workflow Troubleshooting

## ✅ Current Status
- Workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` ✅
- File meets all GitHub Actions requirements ✅
- Repository structure is correct ✅
- Personal Access Token authentication working ✅

## 🔧 Issue Identified
The workflow file paths have been corrected to match your repository structure:
- Removed `mobile/` prefix from working directories
- Updated package-lock.json path
- Fixed android folder references

## 🚀 Next Steps to Start Build

### Option 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)
1. **Go to Actions**: https://github.com/AtharvaSatav/starthbourne-partners-mobile/actions
2. **Look for**: "Build Android APK" workflow (should appear after refresh)
3. **Click**: "Run workflow" button
4. **Confirm**: Click "Run workflow" again
5. **Monitor**: Watch real-time build progress (5-8 minutes)

### Option 2: Push Updated Workflow
Since the workflow file was updated with correct paths:
1. **Make small edit on GitHub**: Edit README.md directly on GitHub website
2. **Commit change**: This triggers the workflow automatically
3. **Watch build**: Go to Actions tab to monitor progress

### Option 3: Wait for Detection
GitHub sometimes takes 5-10 minutes to detect new/updated workflows:
- **Refresh**: Actions page every few minutes
- **Look for**: "Build Android APK" in workflow list

## 📋 Workflow Features
Your workflow includes all required elements:

**✅ Proper Structure**:
- Location: `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`
- Triggers: push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch
- Runner: ubuntu-latest

**✅ Required Steps**:
- Checkout repository: `actions/checkout@v4`
- Setup Java 17: `actions/setup-java@v4`
- Setup Android SDK: `android-actions/setup-android@v3`
- Make gradlew executable: `chmod +x gradlew`
- Build APK: `./gradlew assembleRelease`
- Upload artifacts: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

**✅ Additional Features**:
- Automatic release creation on main branch
- Professional release notes with installation instructions
- APK artifact retention for 30 days
- Build caching for faster subsequent builds

## 🎯 Expected Build Process

**Build Steps (5-8 minutes total)**:
1. **Checkout code** (30 seconds)
2. **Setup Node.js** (30 seconds)
3. **Setup Java 17** (1 minute)
4. **Setup Android SDK** (2 minutes)
5. **Install dependencies** (1 minute)
6. **Build APK** (3-4 minutes) - longest step
7. **Upload artifacts** (30 seconds)
8. **Create release** (30 seconds)

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Green checkmark in Actions tab
- 📱 APK available in Releases tab
- 📦 Artifact downloadable from build run

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If workflow doesn't appear**:
- Refresh Actions page
- Check repository has .github/workflows/build-android.yml
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub detection

**If build fails**:
- Click on failed build to view logs
- Check specific step that failed
- Common issues: Gradle permissions, dependency conflicts

**If APK not found**:
- Check Releases tab for automatic release
- Download from Actions → Build run → Artifacts
- Verify build completed successfully

## 📱 After Success

Once build completes:
1. **Download APK**: From Releases tab or build artifacts
2. **Install on Android**: Enable unknown sources first
3. **Follow setup wizard**: Grant all permissions for full functionality
4. **Test critical alerts**: Send beep log via API
5. **Verify background monitoring**: Close app and test notifications

Your APK will include:
- Critical alert system with screen wake-up
- 24/7 background monitoring when app closed
- Automatic permission setup wizard
- Daily cleanup at 6 PM
- WebSocket connection to Replit backend
