    "source": "monitoring-system"
  }'
```

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **React Native 0.73** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Query** for server state management  
- **React Navigation** for screen management
- **React Native Push Notification** for background alerts
- **React Native Background Fetch** for API polling when closed
- **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence

### Permission System
Automatically requests and manages:
- ‚úÖ **Notifications** - Basic notification access
- ‚úÖ **Critical Alarms** - Exact alarm scheduling  
- ‚úÖ **Display Over Apps** - Full-screen alerts over lock screen
- ‚úÖ **Battery Optimization** - Bypass Android power management
- ‚úÖ **Do Not Disturb** - Break through silent mode
- ‚úÖ **Boot Completion** - Start after device restart
- ‚úÖ **Foreground Service** - Background operation capability

### Background Services
1. **Background Fetch Service** - Polls API every 15 seconds to 2 minutes when app closed
2. **Daily Cleanup Scheduler** - Triggers log archival at 6 PM daily
3. **Push Notification Handler** - Manages alert interactions and acknowledgments

## Development

### Build from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run on Android device
npm run android

# Build release APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Automatic Builds
- **GitHub Actions** builds APK automatically on every commit
- **Download** from Releases tab or Actions artifacts
- **Version numbering** increments automatically

## Testing

### Critical Alert Test
1. **Close app completely** (not just minimize)
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for background service activation
3. **Send beep log** via API
4. **Should receive** persistent critical alert within 2 minutes
5. **Repeating reminders** every 30 seconds until acknowledged

### Background Monitoring Test  
1. **Send regular log** via API while app closed
2. **Should receive** standard notification within 2 minutes
3. **App syncs** when reopened

### Daily Cleanup Test
1. **Set phone time** to 6:00 PM or later
2. **Should trigger** automatic log archival
3. **Check cleanup status** shows last cleanup time

## Troubleshooting

### No Critical Alerts
- Verify all permissions granted in phone settings
- Check battery optimization is disabled for app
- Ensure Do Not Disturb allows this app

### No Background Notifications  
- Confirm app has notification permissions
- Check background app refresh is enabled
- Verify network connectivity

### Setup Wizard Issues
- Manually grant permissions in phone Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Starthbourne Partners
- Restart app to re-check permission status
